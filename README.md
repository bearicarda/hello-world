time to learn something new

<b>My situation:</b></br>
As my life is quite turbulent at the moment i need a change and find something relevant to do.
I try to figure out, what I can do with my actual skills, if I might expand them and specialise even more in the field of Interaction Design and Development, or if I might do something completely analog.
